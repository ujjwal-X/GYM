            atmosphere of the
            performance. Accompanied by the infectious beats of the dhol, a traditional drum, Bhangra dancers showcase a
            series of
            dynamic movements, including jumps, spins, and gestures that reflect the themes of agricultural life and
            celebration. In
            recent years, Bhangra has gained popularity worldwide, transcending cultural boundaries and becoming a
            symbol of
            cultural pride, vitality, and inclusivity. Through its spirited rhythms and joyful expressions, Bhangra
            continues to
            captivate audiences and spread happiness wherever it is performed.</p>
